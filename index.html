    <p><strong>Finally you can have your own virtual pet... <br>Again! <br>And this one happens to be a jack o' lantern. <br>Isn't it a lil cutie?
    <br>I'm glad you think so because it will be YOUR job to love it, play with it, feed it, put it to sleep and HOPEFULLY not kill it. <br> May the odds ever be in your pet's favor         </strong></p>

<!--The backgroud image is going to change to a nighttime cemetery but as for the pet, maybe I can use the dead images for sleep and use a zombie sprite for when it actually dies-->
  <button onclick="eatButton"> FEED</button> <br>
<!--Maybe add an eating sound since I'm not sure how to make it eat-->
  <button onclick="playButton"> PLAY</button> <br>
<!--Use the running images for when play is selected-->
